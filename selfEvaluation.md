# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
 Not confident at all.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I am having a really hard time with the self learning part. I am a visiual learner and its been a really hard trying to ajust to teaching myself. I am very comfortable using google resources but still get confused on how to exicute it.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Really everything about this lesson is still confusing. i get the concept but the writing of the code and the format is what is tripping me up.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
im not really sure what the questions i have are at the moment. i plan on using study hall and my alumni friend for help when needed.
